My First Backend App
This is my first backend application that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up your MongoDB database and update the connection string in config.js or .env file.

Run the application:

bash

npm start
Usage
Use Postman or any API testing tool to test the CRUD operations.
The API endpoints are defined in the routes directory and implemented in the controllers directory.
The Mongoose models are defined in the models directory.
